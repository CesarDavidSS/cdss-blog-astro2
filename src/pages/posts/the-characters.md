## Frieren's Party

Frieren (フリーレン, *Furīren*)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-1)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-germanverb-2)

Main article: [Frieren (character)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieren_(character)> "Frieren (character)")

Voiced by: [Atsumi Tanezaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsumi_Tanezaki "Atsumi Tanezaki")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Anime-ANN-03-2023-3) (Japanese); Mallorie Rodak[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Dub-4) (English)

An elven mage who was a member of the Hero Party. Although she looks young, she was born into a long-lived race of elves and has lived for over a thousand years. Because her sense of time is different from that of humans, she does not mind working for months, if not years, at a time. After the death of Himmel, a member of the party, Frieren regrets not getting to know him better during their ten-year adventure. As a result, she embarks on another journey to learn more about humanity. She also travels with a human wizard apprentice, Fern, after taking her on as an apprentice at Heiter's suggestion.

Over a thousand years ago, the great wizard Flamme saved Frieren when demons attacked her hometown. This experience caused Frieren to develop a deep-seated hatred for demons, fueling her ambition to eliminate them. After the Demon King's death, Frieren dedicated herself to researching demon-slaying magic[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-5) while continuing to kill them whenever she could. As the wizard who has buried the most demons in recorded history, she has earned the moniker "Frieren the Slayer",[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-6) and is feared by the demon race. Despite her accomplishments, Frieren has also faced several defeats and struggles. As an elf, she is often perceived as being insensitive to human emotions. Her occasional clumsiness in social interactions leads others to mistakenly label her as aloof, but she is actually kind and caring.

Fern (フェルン, *Ferun*)[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-7)

Voiced by: [Kana Ichinose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana_Ichinose "Kana Ichinose")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Anime-ANN-08-2023-8) (Japanese); [Jill Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Harris "Jill Harris")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Dub-4) (English)

A powerful young mage and Frieren's apprentice. She is a war orphan from a southern country who lost her parents and was about to commit suicide by jumping off a ravine when Heiter rescued her. As a child, she began training in magic under Heiter's tutelage to become more self-sufficient. She later met Frieren, who visited Heiter when she was nine years old, and requested that Frieren teach her magic so she could become a full-fledged mage. After Heiter's death, by which she has turned fifteen, she embarks on a journey as Frieren's apprentice. Later, she becomes a first-class mage after passing the examination. Though she initially treats Stark coldly, she eventually warms up to him as they bond, but still scolds him when he causes trouble.

Stark (シュタルク, *Shutaruku*)[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-9)

Voiced by: [Chiaki Kobayashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaki_Kobayashi "Chiaki Kobayashi"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Anime-ANN-08-2023-8) Arisa Kiyoto (child)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-AbemaTimes-10) (Japanese); Jordan Dash Cruz[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-BTVA-EN-11) (English)

A young warrior who Eisen raised, who serves as a replacement for him on Frieren's adventure. Since Eisen declines the invitation due to his old age, Stark steps up to be the frontline fighter in battles, a role that Frieren and Fern, being magicians, are unsuited for. Despite his timid nature, Stark is a strong and capable warrior and loyal to his companions. He has a secret crush on Fern, but is often left frustrated by the way she constantly scolds him.

## The Hero Party

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Frierenheroparty.png/220px-Frierenheroparty.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frierenheroparty.png)

The Hero Party (from left to right): Heiter, Frieren, Himmel, and Eisen

A group of warriors that Frieren was part of. They journeyed together for ten years until accomplishing their mission of slaying the Demon King, after which they parted ways. Although the group disbanded at the beginning of the story, they appear regularly in flashbacks.

Himmel (ヒンメル, *Hinmeru*)[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-12)

Voiced by: [Nobuhiko Okamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuhiko_Okamoto "Nobuhiko Okamoto")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Anime-ANN-06-2023-13) (Japanese); [Clifford Chapin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Chapin "Clifford Chapin")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Dub-4) (English)

A human member of the Hero Party. He was the hero of the group and a self-proclaimed handsome man. After seeing a meteor shower together, he and Frieren promise to meet again. He dies shortly after their reunion fifty years later, prompting her to embark on a new journey. Several occasions on their journey showed that he and Frieren had feelings for each other, but Frieren's sense of time and understanding of humans at the time left his feelings ambiguous.

Heiter (ハイター, *Haitā*)[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-14)

Voiced by: [Hiroki Tōchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroki_T%C5%8Dchi "Hiroki Tōchi")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Anime-ANN-06-2023-13) (Japanese); [Jason Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Douglas "Jason Douglas")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Dub-4) (English)

A human member of the Hero Party, who was an alcohol-loving priest. He found, adopted, and raised Fern after the party dissolved, and dies near the beginning of the story.

Eisen (アイゼン, *Aizen*)[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-15)

Voiced by: [Yōji Ueda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dji_Ueda "Yōji Ueda")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Anime-ANN-06-2023-13) (Japanese); Christopher Guerrero[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Dub-4) (English)

A member of the Hero Party. He is a dwarf who, although not as long-lived as elves, has a significantly longer lifespan than humans. However, despite his extended lifespan, he is past his prime and has grown old. As a result, he declines Frieren's invitation to embark on a new adventure, choosing to spend his remaining days in peace and recommending that Stark accompany her instead.

## Demons

A race of monsters that once terrorized the world under the Demon King's leadership until the Hero Party slew him. Since then, weaker remnants of their forces have waged war against the other races. Demons are individualistic creatures whose societal hierarchy is based on power. While they can feel emotions, they do not feel the same emotions as humans do. As a result, they are incompatible with human ideas of morality and eventually pretend to display human emotions to deceive them.

Demon King (魔王, *Maō*)

An ancient ruler of the demon race who lived over 1,000 years ago. Though ultimately defeated by Himmel's hero party, his former castle still stands in Ende, at the continent's northernmost point.

Ironically, the Demon King's desire for "coexistence with humans" led to a devastating war. This conflict decimated both sides, reducing human populations to a third of their peak and bringing demons to the brink of extinction. Under his command were the "Seven Sages of Destruction," powerful demons who controlled key regions of the continent.

The Demon King's legacy continues to impact the world long after his defeat, with his castle and the lingering effects of the war shaping the current geopolitical landscape.

### Demon King's Confidant

Schlacht (シュラハト, *Shurahato*)[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-16)

Schlacht the Omniscient was a demon who was said to be the Demon King's confidant, who could see into the future, and was said to be capable of seeing forward up to a thousand years. About ten years before the Demon King was defeated, he fought against the Hero of the South, leading all of the Seven Sages of Destruction. However, he was defeated in this battle alongside three of the Sages of Destruction.

### Seven Sages of Destruction

The Seven Greater Demons were considered the most powerful among the Demon King's Forces. Three of them were slain by the Hero of the South several years before Himmel assembles his party to confront them.

Aura (アウラ, *Aura*)[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-17)

Voiced by: [Ayana Taketatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayana_Taketatsu "Ayana Taketatsu")[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Anime-ANN-10-2023-18) (Japanese); Corey Pettit[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-BTVA-EN-11) (English)

A member of the Seven Sages of Destruction and an old nemesis of Frieren and the Hero Party, who they managed to defeat many years ago, but she escaped. She wields the Scales of Obedience, which allow her to dominate her opponents and turn them into puppets to decapitate them, which has earned her the moniker “The Guillotine”. When she attempts to use the Scales of Obedience on Frieren, she falls under her control instead and decapitates herself by Frieren's orders.

Macht (マハト, *Mahato*)[[l]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-19)

Macht, also known as Macht of Golden Land, is the last surviving member of the Seven Sages of Destruction. For ages, he was trapped in his self-created Golden Land, locked down by a powerful barrier maintained by the Continental Magic Association. Macht possesses exceptional magical abilities, including an unbreakable gold transmutation curse called Diagolze. Despite being described as relatively moderate for a demon, Macht's combat prowess is legendary. Macht's reputation as the strongest of the Seven Sages stems from his ability to effortlessly defeat groups of elite mages, including those of the highest rank. He once bested Frieren 600 years before the main story's events, and his power remains so formidable that even the present-day Frieren considers him nearly unbeatable.

Grausam (グラオザーム, *Guraozāmu*)[[m]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-20)

Grausam the Miraculous, a master of powerful mental magic capable of deceiving even the mightiest demons. When Schlacht coerced Macht into joining the battle against the Southern Hero, he brought Grausam along to ensure Macht's compliance. Macht, unable to counter Grausam’s illusion magic, was forced to submit.

Later, Grausam assumed a leadership role among a group sent to eliminate Frieren, which included Solitär, Rivale, and Tote. When Tote abandoned the mission, the remaining three launched an assault on Himmel's party. Grausam employed his "Guide to Paradise" (Ancillasiela) spell to trap Himmel and Frieren in an illusion. However, he found himself cornered by Himmel, who could fight even while ensnared in the illusion. Though Grausam seemed poised to unveil a trump card when backed into a corner, Solitär intervened, and they retreated. In the aftermath of the Demon King's defeat, it is said that Grausam, too, met his demise.

Böse (ベーゼ, *Bēze*)[[n]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-21)

The Immortal Böse was one of the Seven Sages of Destruction. Böse and the other Sages of Destruction fought against Hero of the South, though he survived the encounter. Eventually, he was defeated by the Hero Party after Frieren helped Himmel visualize how to break his nigh impenetrable barrier magic.

### Greater demons

Solitär (ソリテール, *Soritēru*)[[o]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-22)

Solitär is a Greater Demon known for her youthful appearance and eccentric interest in studying humanity. Despite her immense magical prowess, rivaling that of Macht, she remains an "unnamed great demon" in human records, likely due to her habit of eliminating all humans she encounters. Solitär played a crucial role in Macht's development, teaching him about convergent evolution and human magic, and later assisted in destroying the great barrier of the Golden Land.

Solitär possesses extraordinary magical abilities, including precise mana control, powerful offensive strikes, and nearly impenetrable defensive capabilities. Her combat skills are so formidable that even Frieren considers her on par with Macht. Solitär is also characterized by her talkative nature, often engaging in prolonged "conversations" to torment her opponents. Her actions are driven by a desire to witness the "tragic end" of coexistence between demons and humans, viewing such ideas as dangerous for demonkind.

Tot (トート, *Tōto*)[[p]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-23)

Also known as the Saint of the End, she is a Greater Demon, developing a curse powerful enough to envelop the entire planet. Solitär recruits her to fight Himmel's Party in the past, but she retreats, claiming that she is no good at fighting and wants to live peacefully and quietly until the completion of her curse magic. Solitär noted that Tot's battlefield is in the future, long after Demon King was defeated.

Rivale (リヴァーレ, *Rivāre*)[[q]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-24)

Rivale, also known as the Bloody God of War, is a Greater Demon. Solitär recruits him to fight the Hero Party. His magic is to generate any weapon he wishes to fight with, using this to create an axe to face Eisen with. He survived the encounter and later attacked Stark's village.

### Other demons

Qual (クヴァール, *Kuvāru*)[[r]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-25)

Also Known as the "Elder Sage of Corruption", the Hero Party sealed him away as he was too strong to defeat. Several decades later, Frieren unseals and destroys him with Fern's assistance. Qual is the creator of "Zoltraak", a powerful offensive magic which becomes the mages' standard attack spell after human researchers studied and deciphered it while he was sealed.

Lügner (リュグナー, *Ryugunā*)[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-27)

Voiced by: [Junichi Suwabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junichi_Suwabe "Junichi Suwabe")[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-Anime-ANN-10-2023-18) (Japanese); Blake McNamara[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-BTVA-EN-11) (English)

Zart (ツァルト, *Tsaruto*)[[w]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-31)

Zart, also known as The Lingering Shadow, was one of Grausam's servants with a potent personal magic called Spacial Transferrence Magic, allowing him to teleport his opponents high into the sky, which would prove lethal in the era of the Demon King when humanity's magic had not yet learned flight magic from studying demons.

## Mages

### Continental Mage Association

Serie (ゼーリエ, *Zērie*)[[x]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-32)

An ancient elf who has lived since time immemorial. Serie is an influential wizard and Flamme's instructor. She met Frieren about 1,000 years prior to the story's events. She is dubbed a living grimoire, as she is believed to possess nearly all of human history's magic and many consider her to be the closest wizard to the Almighty Goddess.

About half a century before the main story, Serie founded the Continental Magic Association. She sought exceptional mages who had honed their skills during the conflict with the Demon King's forces, shaping generations of wizards. However, none of her disciples ever approached her level, and all passed away before her.

Even with her power restrained, Serie’s aura is so overwhelming that it instills fear in those around her. The story frequently highlights her unmatched strength, such as when she effortlessly overpowered Macht of the Golden Land and bluntly criticized Frieren as a "mage whose skills are lacking for her age," while dismissing Flamme as a failure.

She also possesses another powerful and unique spell, making her a force to be reckoned with. Übel's abilities eventually earn her a passing mark in the final exam, courtesy of Serie, who silently acknowledges her strength by promoting her to the rank of first-class mage.

Land (ラント, *Ranto*)[[ag]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#cite_note-43)

Fern's other teammate, a mysterious and calculating individual who approaches life with a detached sense of caution. He is perpetually wary of others, preferring to keep them at arm's length, and has a tendency to prioritize his own safety above all else. This mindset is reflected in his unique magical abilities, which allow him to create perfect clones of himself. These clones are so convincing that they can even take the exam in his place, allowing him to remain safe and secure in his own home while still achieving his goals. However, Serie sees through his clone spell, recognizing that the clone is merely a proxy. Rather than penalizing him for his unorthodox approach, Serie is impressed by his bold and daring nature, acknowledging that it takes a certain level of bravery and skill to pull off such a feat and progress to the final stage of the evaluation.
